# __Sprint 5__ (Scrum Master: Daniel)

## __Sprint goal:__  
Our goal for this sprint is to finish up our Minimal Viable Product (MVP), so we have something to display for the expo. This includes polishing up some of our codebase as well as
finishing some of the functionality that allows users to actually use this software for a project.

## __Product log:__ 
- Create user authentication sessions on backend server
- Create sql queries to get data by inserting userID from user session
- Document how to handle edge cases on graph and implement solution
- Create separate page for displaying teams and related functionality
- Create teams table in db and define required data
- Improve api requests to get and send data to backend using async requests with a callback to update data in redux on successful db updates.
- Implement teams into authenticated routes for getting data such that a user has access to all project associated with teams they are on (stretch goal for this sprint)
- Hookup task creation user dropdown to pull from teams/users on existing projects (stretch goal for this sprint)

### Meeting 2/22:
We met today to talk about what we have done so far and what we are going to be working on this week. Some of us have been busy with another course as an assignment was due this Monday, but were still able to get some work completed. Daniel is working on the tooltip for the graph that displays info about each project/task/subtask. Trevor helped Daniel immensely with completing this, as well working on backend server calls. Matthew is working on the backend as well and hasn't noted any roadblocks currently, and Kyler is working on the team management page so that a employee or manager can add new people to the project and change who has access to the project. Will be meeting Wednesday with our project partner Taj.
