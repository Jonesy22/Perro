# __Sprint 5__ (Scrum Master: Daniel)

## __Sprint goal:__  
Our goal for this sprint is to finish up our Minimal Viable Product (MVP), so we have something to display for the expo. This includes polishing up some of our codebase as well as
finishing some of the functionality that allows users to actually use this software for a project.

## __Product log:__ 
- Create user entity in the backend that can then be used in the team management page
- Connect this user entity to the task modal so that a user can be assigned a task
- Connect Redux with the backend so we can store user information and easily pull from there
- Polish / Edit data visualization
- Finish graph tool tip when hovering over points on the graph
## __Member tasks:__ 
Kyler: Team management page. Ensuring that a user in the team can view their own team, and that it works as intended.

Matthew: Backend server management. Making sure the Google Login feature is working as intended and working on the routes.

Daniel: Graph tool tip. Hovering over a point in the line which marks a task, will pull up information from that task, or from that commit. Handling edge cases where a commit and estimate are plotted at the same point.

Trevor: Ability to link to tasks, async api requests from components that update redux on return.

## __Scrum record:__ 

### Meeting 2/22:
We met today to talk about what we have done so far and what we are going to be working on this week. Some of us have been busy with another course as an assignment was due this Monday, but were still able to get some work completed. Daniel is working on the tooltip for the graph that displays info about each project/task/subtask. Trevor helped Daniel immensely with completing this, as well working on backend server calls. Matthew is working on the backend as well and hasn't noted any roadblocks currently, and Kyler is working on the team management page so that a employee or manager can add new people to the project and change who has access to the project. Will be meeting Wednesday with our project partner Taj.
