In this meeting we were making sure everyone was on track to complete their tasks by our decided date of 4/30. Kyler was ready to jump into 
writing his code after 3 other assignments, Matthew was finishing up updating the reporter when they are changed on the backend, Daniel was
able to title attributes for the modal with Trevors help and he is looking into the search bar functionality, and Trevor was finishing up the 
backend teams feature.
