<h1>Sprint 5 Review</h1>
<body>This sprint was on par like the rest of our sprints, and we gotsome good work done to as we are nearing the end of the term.
We essentially completed our MVP, and we have a working product now. We weren't able to polish as much as we thought originally as 
other things came up with our core implementation, but we are not falling behind by any means. Going into our next sprint,
we are feeling good as we are on track with what we predicted towards the beginning of the term with few edits, and optimistic
about our progress moving forward. We will set ourselves up so we have just a few remaining tasks after spring break. We were a bit confused
as we progressed this term as we were told different due dates for various things, and made us feel a bit uneasy hearing different information
regarding how long we could keep developing in spring term, but we have since solved that issue and know we will have enough time to get where
we want to be in the spring.
