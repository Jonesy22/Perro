<h1>Sprint 3 Review</h1>
<body>
 After this sprint we accomplished our goal and created a backend server that will help us finish the rest of the application. The rest of the frontend in the 
 application is ready to serve the fledgling backend that we have created. Our team is now working on building the existing backend server to implement a login and
 authentication feature, develop the database, pass data around the frontend, and develop a new team page for project teams. The sprint also saw greater team 
 communication and collaboration with issues we faced when in development. We were also successful in communicating with our project partner, Taj about project
 expectations. The app is almost ready for a demo and we are excited to keep going forward at this current pace.
