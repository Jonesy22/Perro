<h1>Sprint 3 Review</h1>
<body>
With our second sprint completed, we've met our sprint goal and learned valuable lessons that will help us in our future sprints. Our team is now implementing
components that require coordination and communication to execute. Many members of our team are learning the tools we are using on the fly. To complete our tasks
for this sprint we had to work together and share the knowledge we've learned. This communication and collaboration is going to continue to play an important role
as our components increase in complexity. Our team has also learned the importance of the project backlog as a way to estimate
 the amount of work remaining. For our next sprint we are going to try and flush out our backlog to better gauge our progress. Overall the second sprint was a
 success. This success can be attributed to our teamwork and communication. With continued teamwork and applying the lessons from this sprint, we are confident
 heading into the third sprint.
