In this sprint we've begun putting the finishing touches on our project. The team has started working on some stretch goals like adding search functionality for our projects and tasks. Additionally, the teams section is coming together. We think we are on track to deliver a polished project that will meet our minimum viable product and add some useful features as well. We have had weekly communication with our project partner and have fallen into a good groove with team communication.
