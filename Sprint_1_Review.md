# __Sprint 1 Review__
Overall our first sprint was pretty successful. This sprint made us all realize the importance of documentation and assigning tasks, working on feature branches,
and then combining our work, opposed to sitting and just coding on our own, as this is a group project. During this sprint, we have decided to use React for our front end,
and Redux for implementation in future sprints (for saving application state), and we will also decide a back end language moving forward. We had roadblocks such as not knowing the intended flow of the
project, as all we have to go off of is one screenshot of a container, which is a small part of the overall application. However, after meeting with our project partner we 
were able to get a better idea of the flow, and will implement according to this in the coming sprints.
