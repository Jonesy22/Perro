### Meeting 11/3:
Recapped what we have all contributed so far. Kyler is going to implement the signup/login button, as well as a navbar that allows to switch pages. Planning on finishing those components by Wednesday, we will meet Thursday 10/12 instead of normal friday meeting, so we can debreif before the demo Friday. Kyler will reach out to the team if he needs help with anything this week. We will continue to think about stretch goals and what we can implement down the line as we continue implementing. Need to get in contact with Taj to confirm a meeting next Tuesday. By Thursday we need to ensure our prototype is working how we want, so we can showcase it Friday during class. 


### Meeting 11/2:
Created the react app and pushed to master branch. Project button and drop down task list is pushed to master branch. Summary button is waiting to be merged to master. Data button and Tracking button are soon to be implemented. Will discuss continue to discuss over Discord about any issues that may come up. Next thing to work on as a group and divide tasks is importing the components into app.js.

### Meeting 10/30:
Initial meeting, tasks assigned and will update on Monday's meeting. We got an idea of where to start from the picture on the GitHub we were shown by our project partner Taj. We decided we should start with implementing the buttons, the dropdown, and some styling for our website. We split these up to each team member, and will work on these during the sprint, and contact each other over Discord if any issues arise.
